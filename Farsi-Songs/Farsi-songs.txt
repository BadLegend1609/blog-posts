Music, something you listen to every time. Whenever you are high, low, excited, depressed, natural. It's a daily routine of every person. It is something that has no marriers or boundaries. Irrespective of language, we listen to it, if we feel good, we play it again, and this cycle goes on...
Farsi songs, AKA "Persian Traditional Music" are such songs liked by a huge number of people. Whenever we hear a song we try to find a rhythm in it that matches our lives; and Farsi songs are good examples of it. Mainly they're written in the Arabic language but we can find some examples of it in Hindi too. "Afghan Jalebi" by Asrar and Akhtar Chanal Zahri is a famous song loved by everyone. These songs make the use of indigenous instruments such as dhol, naqare, sorna, etc. The way it's played makes it different and likable by all.
